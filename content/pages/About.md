title: About

The main goal of these few pages is to publish some ideas and projects I have, as they come. By this I mean there won't be any regular updates nor predefined schedule regarding this site. I will upload opinions and articles as the muses take me.

My main subject will be software project and sometime some *rants* about the news and general problems or topics that come to me.

I hope nonetheless that you may find some interesting ideas, questions and even maybe some answers.

### Software
As a software engineer, I am not only interested in **Operating Systems** and **Programming Languages** as topics but also in **software architecture and design**.

### Photo
When I am not spending time hacking, I enjoy taking pictures. My usual subjects are my family, friends and Nature, as our beautiful planet so generously provides us.
